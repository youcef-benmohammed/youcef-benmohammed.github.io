  This project realized during my tutored project at Center for Integrative Biology, this project involved analyzing ChIP-seq data to identify protein-binding sites and Hi-C data to map 3D DNA interactions in *C. elegans*. This work aimed to elucidate the impact of DNA folding on gene expression regulation.
